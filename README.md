# ADM---HW3---Group13
This is the homework 3 for Data Science ADM

## Find the perfect place to stay in Texas!

In this homework we analyze the text of Airbnb property listings and building a search engine. In particular we build three increasingly performing search engines:

1) The first give back all the announcements that contain the key words queried

2) The second give back the top k announcements more similar with the query. k is decided by the user

3) The third do the same thing of the previous but use another idea of "similar", decided by us

- Then we answer to all 5 Research Questions explaining the results through plots.
- Finally we make all the Core Research Questions.

A detailed description is provided in the file.
